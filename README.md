<p>Go into Carzaty_car_shelf_life_model folder, the python code(all the code is in data_gathering.py file) </p>
<p>Check the car_shelf_life.csv, In the code that I wrote, I was collecting data from database but If you want to run the code you will have to read it from csv </p>
<p> I am using python libraries numpy and pandas for data gathering, "sklearn" for preprocessing (only for one hot encoding)
and then keras for building models (Deep Neural Network)</p>
<p> Columns are in that order year, make of the car, model of the car, body type of the car, engine capacity, mileage and then the target vector, "life"</p>

<p> to install dependencies run pip install requirements.txt</p?
<p>Let me know if you need any thing else to undersatand the code base</p>
